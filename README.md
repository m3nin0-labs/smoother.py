## smoother.py - Spatial Smoothing in Python

This Python import library makes it possible to use the spatial smoothing functions implemented by Rolf Simoes in the SITS package.

The original functions are all written in C++, using the package armadillo. Then, through karma, they were imported into Python and are available in this library.

Avaliable functions:

- `bayes_smoother`
- `kernel_smoother`
- `bilinear_smoother`
